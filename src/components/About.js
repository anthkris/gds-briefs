      <p>In 2016, I declared a year of the project.</p>
      <p>As a part of that, I wrote a little ebook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/eOwj" class="link-color-red">Go Design
        Something</a> about making a really great portfolio as an instructional designer (I'll be redesigning it pretty soon)
        and I've been thinking for a while about what to do with this site.</p>
      <p>I've had the privilege to speak with several instructional design newbies about breaking into ID.
      And, for a while now, I've had a passion for helping other newbie instructional designers practice their craft.
      So, I decided that a perfect companion arc to my current projects and practice would be a website that generated project ideas.</p>
      <p>If you've wanted to get started on a project but you couldn't figure out how to get started, this is the site to get you going.</p>
      <p>If you've got a short brief idea, you can can <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/8OjBfa4IOn4Uy7TD2" class="link-color-red">submit it to share with others.</a></p>
