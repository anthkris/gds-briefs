Portfolio project briefs for instructional designers

If you're looking for some inspiration to create portfolio projects, Go Design Something is the site for you!

## How to Use this Site

Every visit to the site will serve up a project brief. You can print it, tweet it or copy it to a document so that you can begin a personal portfolio project. Each brief contains:

- Audience description
- Brief project/problem description
- Deliverables for the project (the part you make for your portfolio)
- Inspiration (links to similar projects to kick start your ideas)

## Got Briefs to Share?

It would be awesome to continue growing this repo! I'm looking for more project briefs that we can add to help other instructional designers make projects. You might sanitize a brief from a project you completed at work or tweak a challenge you received during an interview.

If you've got a brief you can share, submit it with this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-m4vBi0Yz1nCvBBj32LULSdxpt_YaeTZTaTK_vdQObL8ihg/viewform?c=0&w=1).
